# XMIDICtrl_Configs

## What is XMIDICtrl?
XMIDICtrl is a plugin by Marco Auer that allows the user to turn a MIDI device (among other things, as it develops) into a button box for X-Plane. It is a very useful tool, get it here: https://github.com/mauer/xmidictrl

## What are these configs?
I have personal preferences for my sim planes/hardware that others may not jive with, so I customize my config files accordingly and make custom overlays (which I print, cut, and laminate to stick onto my X Touch Mini with sticky tak). They are shared here so anyone can make use of them.

Apologies to the original creators I rip the files from (usually Marco) if I miss some stuff I should be changing due to license terms or whatever. Let me know if you find something and I will fix it.
